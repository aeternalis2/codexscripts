# codexscripts
A collection of python scripts interacting with the website RPGCodex.

Designed to run from command line and be relatively easy to use for non-coders. RPGCodex forum account is required as access to most functions is blocked for unregistered users. Many functions also require an account with GD access, which is unlocked via being registered for 12 months, or donating some cash to fuel DarkUnderlord's meth habit.

You will need to install python and requests library which can be found here: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
